# Welcome to my portfolio !

i'm a computer science student interested in many fields of IT, but mainly, software engineering,
low-level stuff, systems networking & management.

not only that, i like drawing, taking pictures, playing music among many other things.

i'm also trilingual, i speak english, french and portuguese and about every page on my
portfolio is translated in each of those languages.

And if somehow, that makes you want to know [more about me...](./about-me)
